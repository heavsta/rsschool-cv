## Summary

I stepped into the world of programming during the first covid lockdown. As I was stuck in my appartment I decided to give a try to something I never dared starting seriously. I taught myself the basics of web development grabbing lectures and courses here and there on the web and landed my first job in less than a year.  
I have the will to deepen my knowledge in both front and back end, as I find of each of them differently interesting. I am looking forward to join an IT company where I could blossom at my job, actively participating, sharing, creating and solving issues within a motivated team.

## Code example

I've been recently very interested in Go so here's a code snippet:

```go
// Bubble Sorting Algorithm in Go

func BubbleSort(sli []int) {
	l := len(sli)

	for i := range sli[:l] {
		for j := range sli[:l-i-1] {
			if sli[j] > sli[j+1] {
				Swap(sli, j)
			}
		}
	}
}

func Swap(sli []int, i int) {
	sli[i], sli[i+1] = sli[i+1], sli[i]
}
```
